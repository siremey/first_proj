Step 5: Work with spatial data
There are several core skills that are fundamental for analyzing data spatially:
• Sort and query
• Filter
• Symbolize
• Classify

Y (latitude) given first and then X (longitude). On the globe, the X axis is the equator, and the Y axis is the prime meridian. Negative X values therefore represent locations in the western hemisphere, while negative Y values indicate locations in the southern hemisphere.

Quantile evaluates the number of data values that you are mapping and splits the classes so
that the same number of observations exists in each class. In the case of world demographic
mapping, 254 features are being mapped, leaving roughly 50 countries in each class.

These natural breaks are based on natural groupings that maximize the differences between
the classes.



SQL
[programming] Acronym for Structured Query Language. A syntax for retrieving and manipulating data from a relational database. SQL has become an industry standard query language in most relational database management systems.


map extent
[cartography] The limit of the geographic area shown on a map, usually defined by a rectangle. In a dynamic map display, the map extent can be changed by zooming and panning.


proximity analysis
[spatial analysis] A type of analysis in which geographic features (points, lines, polygons, or raster cells) are selected based on their distance from other features or cells.


Determining the proximity of features or the relationship between a selected point and its
neighboring features is known as proximity analysis


A buffer (https://bit.ly/2Rp7CuH) can be used to create an area around a feature.
